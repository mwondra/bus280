There is concrete below me and a sky above so blue.
I'm finally leaving Austin and I wish it was with you.
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure.
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June.
You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon.
But babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt.
Repression is my Heaven but I'd rather go through hell.
It's about time that I left Austin. 
About time you settled down with a man who doesn't move as quick as trains rolling through town.
About time that I faced the hard times I've let go.
Love was just an ocean, I would drown before I float.
You remember getting drunk on the outskirts of this town.
When I gave you all I had but it still let you down?
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died.
Wish I was born with concrete shoes but I'm leaving tonight.
It's about time that I left Austin.
About time you settled down with a man who doesn't move as quick as the trains rolling through town.
About time that I faced the hard times I've let go.
Love was just an ocean, I would drown before I float.
There's concrete below me and a sky above so blue.
People ruin people, I don't wanna ruin you.
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure.
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
And I'm finally gone from Austin.
You finally settled down with a man who didn't move as quick as the trains that rolled through town.
I've finally had to face the hard times I've let go.
If loving you was an ocean, I would have drowned so you could float.
