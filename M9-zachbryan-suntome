5:34 a.m., I was about to start my day.
But she laying there across me, so I stayed anyway.
Arms tied, legs numb, her wrapped around my knee.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
I don't recall what you were wearing on the first night we met.
Besides the subtle cloud around you from my last cigarette.
And you come from a good place with a happy family.
The only bad you've ever done was to see the good in me.
But I've been living, waiting on the day that the good Lord willing, sends you out my way.
I've seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
And I remember being younger and my mother told me the truth.
Find someone who grows flowers in the darkest parts of you.
Take heed when things get hard and don't you ever turn around.
You'll find someone, someday, somewhere that grows you to the clouds.
And you walked me home that evening when I could barely walk.
And you spoke to me so sweetly on the days I couldn't talk.
And now I'm seeing clearly, and I'm growing up so free.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
I've been living, waiting on the day that the good Lord willing, sends you out my way.
I've seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
