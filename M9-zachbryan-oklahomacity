Old friend, it's been awhile, and I ain't spoke to you in years.
And often times boys from this town put wheels down and disappear.
Mrs. Cole asked about you just three days back and I had no answer to give her.
I told her that you moved way out West to write some songs and grow a little more bitter.
The kids talk about you around here like you're some kind of legend.
I wonder if they know a thousand sunrises ago you were eager just like them?
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride back to this side of Oklahoma City.
There will be a porch light on from the post you leaned on before you wound up on the wrong side of pity.
And often times I pray for you and often times I don't.
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you, or the fear of new hellos?
Won't stay long because you won't stop your running.
Wait for tomorrow until tomorrow's not coming.
Heard you landed in Tulsa while he slipped away.
Is that the reason your fleeing the fields we hauled hay?
Heat this July or the dark last December.
Look in my eyes and you might remember weed out in Norman, the Stillwater strip.
Run far enough boy and you're bound to trip.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride back to this side of Oklahoma City.
There will be a porch light on from the post you leaned on before you wound up on the wrong side of pity.
And often times I pray for you and often times I don't.
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you, or the fear of new hellos?
You never stay long because you won't stop your running.
Wait for tomorrow until tomorrow's not coming.
