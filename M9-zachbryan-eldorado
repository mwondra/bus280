Did you ever make it back to El Dorado?
I'd call and ask, but hell if I know if I still got your number or if you care.
You moved away when you were younger.
Was it escape or was it hunger?
Kansas ain't no place to be a man.
You used to say you'd settle down with that kind girl from school in town.
She was gone before you got back home.
To El Dorado, hell if I know if you're still alive.
There's a note in the glovebox in your drive.
El Dorado, hell if they know the difference in a hero.
And a man I wish was still by my side.
Seventeen years old, how our grins look scary brave.
My mama always said we look so handsome when we shave.
You used to say, "If not you, then who?" and you'd go a thousand times or two.
Now your name's up on a sign in El Dorado driving through.
In El Dorado, hell if I know if you're still alive.
There's a note in the glovebox in your drive.
El Dorado, hell if they know the difference in a hero.
And a man I wish was still by my side.
You're in every last memory alive.
And I called last week to talk to my favorite old devil dog.
They told me he had finally headed home.
