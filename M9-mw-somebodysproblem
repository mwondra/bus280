An Alabama red four-runner pulled into the party with a 30-A sticker on the back windshield.
Two-tone tank top slipping off her shoulder.
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still.
Ooh, I know where this is going. 
I already know it.
She's somebody's problem. She's somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find.
Somebody's best day. Somebody's worst night.
Somebody's reason for leaving on the porch light.
Thinking about them tan lines, and I'm thinking damn. 
I'd love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes.
Sh–µ's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's about to be mine.
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her.
Kinda girl where your friends tell you "Don't mess it up".
Kinda girl that goes from trying to just to get her number to sliding through the summer to talking about love.
Ooh, I think I'm liking where it's going.
I'd like to try me some of somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye.
Somebody's last call number that they can't find.
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night.
Somebody's reason for leaving on the porch light.
Thinking about them tan lines, and I'm thinkin' damn.
I'd love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes.
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's about to be mine.
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishing.
Oh, let me get to fixing somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye.
Somebody's last call number that they can't find.
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night.
Somebody's reason for leaving on the porch light.
Thinking about them tan lines. And I'm thinking damn, I'd love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes.
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's about to be mine.
