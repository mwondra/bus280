Smoke on my clothes, liquor on my breath.
Devil on my shoulder, strangers in my bed.
Pills in my pocket, ashes on the floor.
These bad decisions keep on knocking on my door.
I know you think you left me all alone.
I hate to say you couldn't be more wrong.
I've got Copenhagen, whiskey straight, empty bottle, promise breaking. 
All the ways I let you down, down.
What went around came back around to Sunday mornin' still asleep.
Traded angels for my demons.
I ain't lonely since your leaving.
I've got me and all your reasons.
Like all the lies I ever told, that change I never did.
All the times that I was cold, all that broke you couldn't fix.
I know you did just what you had to do.
You looked around and saw there wasn't no room for you.
Just Copenhagen, whiskey straight.
Empty bottle, promise breaking. 
All the ways I let you down, down.
What went around came back around to Sunday mornin' still asleep.
Traded angels for my demons.
I ain't lonely since your leaving.
I've got me and all your reasons.
I know you wanna be the one for me.
No wonder why you had to run from me.
Hell, even I done had enough of me.
Now all I got to keep me company, is some Copenhagen, whiskey straight, and empty bottle, promise breaking.
All the ways I let you down, down.
What went around came back around.
Sunday morning still asleep.
Traded angels for my demons.
I ain't lonely since your leaving.
I've got me and all your reasons.
It's just me and all your reasons.
