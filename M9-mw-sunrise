On my Fridays when it's whiskey, I go back to Cincy.
That Ohio night you tricked me into buying all your shots.
Got your ghost up in my Chevy. 
Shotgun looking read gor them parties where you'd let me spin you around and show you off.
I been trying to get away from you for a while now.
But there ain't no setting you down.
You're my sunrise, you keep coming up.
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation.
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup.
You're the memories I'm drinking, you're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl.
It don't matter how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from. 
Used to be my late nights. 
You loved me until the daylights.
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep coming up
You keep coming up.
Coming up at 8 am, 9 am
All the way to 10 pm when my day ends.
Laying down and there you are in my Amens.
Morning light and you're there on my mind again.
You're my sunrise, you keep coming up.
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation.
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup.
You're the memories I'm drinking.
You're the thoughts I'm always thinkin', girl.
It don't matter how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from.
Used to be my late nights, loved me 'til the daylights, but now you're just my sunrise, you keep coming up.
Yeah, you keep coming up.
You keep coming up.
There ain't no blinds to close, covers to throw over my head.
Ever since you left you're my sunrise, you keep coming up.
You're in every conversation, every smoky situation.
If it's water, if it's whiskey in my cup.
You're the memories I'm drinking, you're the thoughts I'm always thinking, girl.
It don't matter how far I run, you're the one that I can't run from.
Used to be my late nights, loved me until the daylights.
Now you're just my sunrise, you keep coming up.
Yeah, you keep coming up.
