I don't know where the hell it comes from.
Got no idea where it goes when it leaves.
And when it's here, it's here, and when it's gone, it's gone.
Kinda like them smoky mountain fall time trees.
I guess I'll leave it to something bigger to figure it all out.
But I sure could use a little breeze right now.
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere got a secret they wanna share.
On why it does to her what it does to dust.
Really just ain't fair.
And why it always takes her with it and only brings her back now and then.
I guess I've always been wondering about the wind.
She sits there like a feather just waiting on a gale.
By the time I pushed off, she already caught sail.
I'm always waiting to put my anchor down.
But I sure could use a little breeze right now.
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere got a secret they wanna share.
On why it does to her what it does to dust.
Really just ain't fair.
And why it always takes her with it and only brings her back now and then.
I guess I've always been wondering about the wind.
Hey, I can taste the rain, I can see the sun.
And that makes sense to me.
But this feels like one I that I can't outrun.
Guess I'm running just to see.
If anybody out there somewhere got a secret they wanna share.
On why it does to her what it does to dust.
Really just ain't fair.
And why it always takes her with it and only brings her back now and then.
I guess I've always been wondering about the wind.
And why it always takes her with it and leaves me hanging on a limb.
Just wondering about the wind.
