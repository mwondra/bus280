Did you ever make it back to El Dorado?
I'd call and ask, but hell if I know if I still got your number or if you care.
You moved away when you were younger.
Was it escape or was it hunger?
Kansas ain't no place to be a man.
You used to say you'd settle down with that kind girl from school in town.
She was gone before you got back home.
To El Dorado, hell if I know if you're still alive.
There's a note in the glovebox in your drive.
El Dorado, hell if they know the difference in a hero.
And a man I wish was still by my side.
Seventeen years old, how our grins look scary brave.
My mama always said we look so handsome when we shave.
You used to say, "If not you, then who?" and you'd go a thousand times or two.
Now your name's up on a sign in El Dorado driving through.
In El Dorado, hell if I know if you're still alive.
There's a note in the glovebox in your drive.
El Dorado, hell if they know the difference in a hero.
And a man I wish was still by my side.
You're in every last memory alive.
And I called last week to talk to my favorite old devil dog.
They told me he had finally headed home.
There is concrete below me and a sky above so blue.
I'm finally leaving Austin and I wish it was with you.
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure.
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June.
You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon.
But babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt.
Repression is my Heaven but I'd rather go through hell.
It's about time that I left Austin. 
About time you settled down with a man who doesn't move as quick as trains rolling through town.
About time that I faced the hard times I've let go.
Love was just an ocean, I would drown before I float.
You remember getting drunk on the outskirts of this town.
When I gave you all I had but it still let you down?
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died.
Wish I was born with concrete shoes but I'm leaving tonight.
It's about time that I left Austin.
About time you settled down with a man who doesn't move as quick as the trains rolling through town.
About time that I faced the hard times I've let go.
Love was just an ocean, I would drown before I float.
There's concrete below me and a sky above so blue.
People ruin people, I don't wanna ruin you.
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure.
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
And I'm finally gone from Austin.
You finally settled down with a man who didn't move as quick as the trains that rolled through town.
I've finally had to face the hard times I've let go.
If loving you was an ocean, I would have drowned so you could float.
Old friend, it's been awhile, and I ain't spoke to you in years.
And often times boys from this town put wheels down and disappear.
Mrs. Cole asked about you just three days back and I had no answer to give her.
I told her that you moved way out West to write some songs and grow a little more bitter.
The kids talk about you around here like you're some kind of legend.
I wonder if they know a thousand sunrises ago you were eager just like them?
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride back to this side of Oklahoma City.
There will be a porch light on from the post you leaned on before you wound up on the wrong side of pity.
And often times I pray for you and often times I don't.
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you, or the fear of new hellos?
Won't stay long because you won't stop your running.
Wait for tomorrow until tomorrow's not coming.
Heard you landed in Tulsa while he slipped away.
Is that the reason your fleeing the fields we hauled hay?
Heat this July or the dark last December.
Look in my eyes and you might remember weed out in Norman, the Stillwater strip.
Run far enough boy and you're bound to trip.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride back to this side of Oklahoma City.
There will be a porch light on from the post you leaned on before you wound up on the wrong side of pity.
And often times I pray for you and often times I don't.
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you, or the fear of new hellos?
You never stay long because you won't stop your running.
Wait for tomorrow until tomorrow's not coming.

It'll be fine by dusk light I'm telling you, baby.
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy.
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw, I don't know much but there's no weight at all.
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't.
Because if I say I miss you I know that you won't.
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun.
Something in the orange tells me we're not done.
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am.
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again.
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home.
I need to hear you say you've been waiting all night.
There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light.
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak.
Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak.
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am.
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again.
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home.
To you I'm just a man, to me you're all I am.
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again.
Something in the orange tells me you're never coming home.
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way the orange touches all things around.
The grass, trees and dew, how I just hate you.
Please turn those headlights around.
Please turn those headlights around.
5:34 a.m., I was about to start my day.
But she laying there across me, so I stayed anyway.
Arms tied, legs numb, her wrapped around my knee.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
I don't recall what you were wearing on the first night we met.
Besides the subtle cloud around you from my last cigarette.
And you come from a good place with a happy family.
The only bad you've ever done was to see the good in me.
But I've been living, waiting on the day that the good Lord willing, sends you out my way.
I've seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
And I remember being younger and my mother told me the truth.
Find someone who grows flowers in the darkest parts of you.
Take heed when things get hard and don't you ever turn around.
You'll find someone, someday, somewhere that grows you to the clouds.
And you walked me home that evening when I could barely walk.
And you spoke to me so sweetly on the days I couldn't talk.
And now I'm seeing clearly, and I'm growing up so free.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
I've been living, waiting on the day that the good Lord willing, sends you out my way.
I've seen hard times, bad luck, all that in-between.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
Sweetest of the sunflowers, yeah, you're the sun to me.
