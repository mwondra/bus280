You say those city boys living in those high rise condos only left you feeling low.
Those little smoke glass fancy cars sure go fast but never got you where you wanted to go.
All I've ever owned is an old seat '72.
Cuddled up, get you falling in love on the bench seat.
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee.
Girl, don't blame me if I slip and call you baby.
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me.
There I go letting my south side show. 
Whiskey whispering on little sweet nothing southernisms, Jack and Seven sipping.
Hoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee.
You say the street lights only ever let you see the skyline.
It's been a long time since the Milky Way, Jupiter and Venus took your breath away.
Yeah like you're taking mine.
What you say we grab some tailgate underneath the stars.
Catch a few fireflies in a moonshine jar.
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee.
Girl, don't blame me if I slip and call you baby.
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me.
There I go letting my south side show. 
Whiskey whispering on little sweet nothing southernisms, Jack and Seven sipping.
Hoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee.
There I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering on.
Little sweet nothing southernisms, Jack and Seven sipping.
Hoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee.
